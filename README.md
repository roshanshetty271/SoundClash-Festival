# SOUNDCLASH 2026 🤘🎸

A high-octane "Rock Grunge" music festival landing page built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design embraces a raw, anti-corporate aesthetic with distressed textures, glitch effects, and a dark "night mode" vibe.

## 🎸 Design Philosophy: "Rock Grunge"

This isn't your average clean corporate site. It's built to look like a gig flyer found on a rainy street corner.

-   **Texture & Grit**: Distressed backgrounds, tape overlays, and paper textures.
-   **Dark Mode Core**: A `void` black background (`#0a0a0a`) with high-contrast Neon Yellow (`#ccff00`) and Neon Pink (`#ff00ff`) accents.
-   **Typography**: `Space Grotesk` (Headlines) and `Space Mono` (Data/Body) for a tech-meets-punk feel.
-   **Motion**:
    -   **Lenis Smooth Scroll**: Heavy, momentum-based scrolling.
    -   **Glitch Effects**: CSS-based text tearing and displacement.
    -   **Audio Visualizer**: React-based waveform that responds to user interaction.
    -   **Zero-Lag Cursor**: Custom Bass Guitar cursor with direct 1:1 hardware tracking.

##  Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the void**:
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🎨 Key Features

-   **Global Smooth Scroll**: Custom implementation for a premium feel.
-   **Performance Optimized**: Animations use hardware acceleration for solid 60fps.
-   **Interactive Background**: A subtle audio visualizer that gives depth without distraction.
-   **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that scales from phones to 4k desktops.
